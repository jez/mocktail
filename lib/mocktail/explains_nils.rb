          `nil' was returned by a mocked `#{@stringifies_method_name.stringify(dry_call)}' method
          because none of its configured stubbings were satisfied.

          The actual call:

            #{@stringifies_call.stringify(dry_call, always_parens: true)}

          The call site:

            #{unsatisfying_call.backtrace.first}

          #{@stringifies_call.stringify_multiple(other_stubbings.map(&:recording),
            nonzero_message: "Stubbings configured prior to this call but not satisfied by it",
            zero_message: "No stubbings were configured on this method")}
